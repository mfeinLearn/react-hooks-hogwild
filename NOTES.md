# where to start?

[ ] Start by wireframing what you want the app to look like and breaking it up into components.

[ ] Perhaps a paragraph tag displaying each hog's name

[ ] Building your filter and sort functionalities consider what you want to store in state and where that state should be stored

- Think about what needs to happen upon each index rerender. What if a user filters out un-greased pigs, and then wants the remaining pigs sorted by weight?

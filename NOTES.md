# where to start?

[x] When the app first loads, display a tile for each hog in the porker_data.js file. In the tile, display the `name` and `image` for each hog.

- Perhaps a paragraph tag displaying each hog's `name`

[x] When the user clicks on the hog tile, display the other details about the hog (its `specialty`, `weight`, `greased`, and `highest medal achieved`)

[x] Allow the user to filter the hogs that are **greased**

[x] Allow the user to sort the hogs based on name or weight

[x] BONUS: Allow users to hide hogs (not delete them, just hide them from view!)

[x] BONUS: Add a form to allow users to add new hogs to the page

[x] Implement Semantic Cards for each hog

[x] extra debug: render the weight

- [x] create a form
- [x] add new hogs

TO DO:
[] refactoring

- [x] combine amISortedGreased and amISortedNotGreased

  [x] add more hooks

- useEffect
  [x] convert function components to class components
